# Vehicle-Rental-System
The Vehicle Rental System is designed to simulate a vehicle rental service. The system utilizes a hierarchy of vehicle classes, including Car, Motorcycle, and Bicycle, which are derived from a base Vehicle class using inheritance. The project aims to demonstrate how inheritance can be utilized to define common attributes and behaviors for different types of vehicles.

Key Features and Functionality of the Vehicle Rental System:

1. Vehicle Hierarchy: The system defines a base class called Vehicle, which serves as the parent class for specific vehicle types. The Car, Motorcycle, and Bicycle classes inherit from the Vehicle class, allowing them to inherit common attributes and behaviors defined in the base class.

2. Vehicle Attributes: Each vehicle class (Car, Motorcycle, Bicycle) has its own set of attributes specific to its type, such as the number of seats for cars, engine specifications for motorcycles, or gear types for bicycles. These attributes are defined in the respective derived classes.

3. Rental Operations: The system enables users to perform rental operations on vehicles. Users can rent a vehicle by specifying the vehicle type and any additional parameters specific to that type (e.g., number of seats for a car). The system handles the rental process by updating the rental status of the vehicle
